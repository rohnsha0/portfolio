    Your medical images like X-rays and MRIs are fed into a special kind of AI called a "Convolutional Neural Network" (CNN). Imagine this network as a web of interconnected neurons, much like the human brain. But instead of thoughts, these neurons process visual information. 
    \nHere's the magic: these neurons have been trained on massive datasets of labeled medical images, learning to recognize patterns linked to specific diseases. Just like doctors identify pneumonia in X-rays, our CNNs do the same, automatically extracting those crucial clues. 
    \nThink of it this way: when you feed in a new image, the CNN analyzes it, calculates the probability of each possible disease, and presents it like a scorecard. It doesn't diagnose, but helps doctors see potential issues they might miss.

    - Get suggested health recommendations based on your recent scan, our knowledge base about you, and your past medical history.
    - Track your daily calorie intake by just scanning the food you eat and we will take care of the rest. Alternatively, you can also manually enter the food you eat.
    - Get yourself a personalized diet plan based on your recent scan, your past medical history, and your daily calorie intake.\n
